/*
Historical life expectancy

When we looked up all the people in our data set that lived more than 90 years, only the latest generation in the data came out. Letâ€™s take a closer look at that phenomenon.

Compute and output the average age of the people in the ancestry data set per century. A person is assigned to a century by taking their year of death, dividing it by 100, and rounding it up, as in Math.ceil(person.died / 100).
*/

var ancestry = JSON.parse(require("../ancestry.js"));
// console.log(ancestry);
function average(array) {
  function plus(a, b) { return a + b; }
  return array.reduce(plus) / array.length;
}

function groupBy(arr){
    var yy = [];
    arr.forEach((a)=>{
      if (yy.indexOf(Math.ceil(a.born/100)) == -1){
        yy.push(Math.ceil(a.born/100))
       }
      //console.log(Math.ceil(a.born/100), a.died, a.born, a.died-a.born)
    })
    
    var result = {}
    for(var i in yy){
      var seg = arr.filter((a)=>Math.ceil(a.born/100) == yy[i]).map((a)=>a.died-a.born)
      result[yy[i]] = average(seg);
      //console.log(yy[i], seg);
    }
  return result
}

console.log(groupBy(ancestry));
